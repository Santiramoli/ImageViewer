## About this project
The objective of this project is to create a small app to visualize images. In my case, I have developed it using **JavaFX**, **Maven** and **git** in the IntelIJ environment. The main advantage is that this platform offers a great variety of resources that allow to create more modern and creative designs.

In addition, I have used SceneBuilder to create the user interface. This software simplifies the development process thanks to the use of graphical elements.
